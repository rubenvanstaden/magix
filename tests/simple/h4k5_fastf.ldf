*** Info: Updated layer order
*** Info: This LDF gives faster but slightly less accurate results. Don't use for mutual coupling

$Parameters
* Global parameters
*  Units is the units used in input files PER METRE. This can be changed to handle large-scale modelling
*    For IC applications (RSFQ circuits), keep Units = 1e-6 (1 micron)
Units             =  1e-6
*  CIFUnitsPerMicron lets InductEx know the CIF coordinate scale
*    If your layout tool puts out CIF files with 100 units per micron (default), use 100
*    If your layout tool uses 1000 units per micron (XIC if not stripped for export), use 1000
*    If you have no idea what this means, keep CIFUnitsPerMicron = 100
CIFUnitsPerMicron =  100

* LAYERS
** Number is GDS layer number
** Name is layer as applied in geometry input file
** Bias is the mask-wafer offset of an object's border in this layer
** Thickness is the layer thickness in microns
** Lamba is the layer's penetration depth in microns (overrides global Lambda)
** Sigma is the layer's bulk conductivity in 1/(Ohms_per_square*UnitSize_in_metres) - overrides global Sigma
** Order is the layer's order during wafer construction - the lowest layer starts at 0, but does not need to be Ground (as in ADP)
** Mask is the mask polarity: {1 = layer objects define material
**                             0 = layer objects not translated to model
**                            -1 = layer objects define cutots }
** Filmtype is the layer material typ: {S = superconductor, N = normal conductor (not segmented), I = isolator, R = resistor, 
**                                      A = auxiliary/don't care}
**    ! See User Manual for difference between N (normal conductor) and R (resistor) for modelling purposes
** HFilaments is the number of filaments segments are divided into over the height (overrides global HFilaments)
** GapMax is the largest dimension of any segment that will not be subdivided into equal-sized smaller segments (overrides global GapMax)
** LayerADD is the number of a layer of which objects are added to current layer (OR operation)
** LayerSUB is the number of a layer of which objects are subtracted from the current layer
** Colour is the DXF colour (for viewing purposes)
